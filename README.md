AQI Analysis – India (Excel Project)

📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **Air Quality Index (AQI) data across Indian states and cities** to understand pollution patterns, seasonal trends, health relationships, and environmental factors.
The complete analysis is performed using **Microsoft Excel** with data cleaning, filtering, and pivot table–based summarization to generate meaningful insights.

🎯 Business Objective
The main goal of this project is to:

* Identify **most and least polluted cities and regions** in India.
* Analyze **monthly and seasonal AQI trends** across locations.
* Study **prominent pollutants in southern states**.
* Observe the **relationship between AQI levels, diseases, and EV adoption**.
* Provide insights useful for **environmental monitoring and public health awareness**.

🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used

📊 Key Insights

1️⃣ Pollution Hotspots
Cities such as **Byrnihat, Delhi, Hajipur, and Gurugram** show consistently **high AQI levels**, indicating unhealthy air quality conditions.

2️⃣ Clean Air Regions
Locations like **Tirunelveli, Madikeri, and Chamarajanagar** maintain **significantly lower AQI**, representing comparatively cleaner environments.

3️⃣ Seasonal AQI Trend
AQI levels **peak during winter months** and **decline during monsoon periods**, highlighting strong seasonal influence on air pollution.

4️⃣ Dominant Pollutants in South India
**PM10 and PM2.5** are identified as the **most frequent prominent pollutants** across southern states.

5️⃣ AQI and Health Relationship
States with **higher AQI levels** tend to report **greater counts of certain diseases**, suggesting a possible environmental health connection.

6️⃣ EV Adoption Observation
Some states with **higher electric vehicle adoption** show **relatively improved AQI levels**, indicating potential environmental benefits.

💡 Business / Environmental Recommendations

* Focus pollution-control efforts on **high-AQI hotspot cities**.
* Strengthen **winter-season mitigation policies** for air quality management.
* Encourage **electric vehicle adoption** in highly polluted regions.
* Use AQI-health correlation insights for **public health planning and awareness**.

🚀 Skills Demonstrated

* Environmental data analysis using Excel
* Pivot table–based insight generation
* Trend and pattern identification
* Converting raw public data into **actionable findings**
* Analytical thinking for **policy and health impact interpretation**
